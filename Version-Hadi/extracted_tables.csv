,Losses of carbon from organic soils are typically several folds compared to carbon,,,,
,stock changes in mineral soils. Typically 0.5–2 cm of peat is lost from the topsoil of,,,,
,cultivated soils due to peat decomposition annually (Gronlund et al. 2008) and that,,,,
represents carbon loss of,,several,tonnes per hectare. Although carbon exchange,,
between the,soil,and atmosphere,forms,the majority ofthe,climaticimpact of
,"cultivated organic soils, full carbon balance estimates are still rare. The annual net",,,,
,ecosystem exchange has varied between −800 and 3000 g m−2 in Finnish studies,,,,
,"(Table 2.3). As the reported values show, even in organic soils photosynthesis may",,,,
,"sometimes exceed carbon loss from the soil, at",,,least,in the case of crops with large
biomass. The,consideration,ofthe,climatic,"impact must,however,",includethe
biomass,,"transported from the ﬁeld, and in most cases,",,thisturns,the ﬁeld to net
,source of carbon even if photosynthesis was able to counteract peat decomposition.,,,,
